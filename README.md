FaceDetect
==========

Face detection for iPhone using OpenCV
--------------------------------------

### About

This project is an example of using [OpenCV][1] on the iPhone.

It provides a simple application that let you take a picture (or select one from your photo library), and that detects the face(s) on the picture.

### Building

The application does not compile (yet) for the iPhone simulator.
You need to build it for your iOS device in order to test it.

### OpenCV port

FaceDetect uses the [OpenCV port][2] provided by Macmade (myself), and which is also [available on GitHub][3].

Project Status
